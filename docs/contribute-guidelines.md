Naming convention

* You are going to read code more often than you write code
  * Chose illustrative names: e.g, for a function that returns a string
    with a time stamp, it is preferable to name it "get_time_stamp(**)"
    rather than "time_stamp(**)".
  * On the other hand, at short while after Edgar Ortiz started
    developing this code he developed a tendinitis in his hands.
    Thanks to tech he was able to code using voice (check serenade.ai),
    it is way easier to code with voice using illustrative words
    rather than acronyms that belong to the jargon of programming
    or the science behind the code.
* Black format inspired in pep-8
* Code lines should not be longer than 79 characters
* Documentation strings lines should not be larger than 73 characters
