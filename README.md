# Satellite-tracking
Low Earth orbit Satellite tracking code using supplemental TLE data from
Celestrak to calculate times and positions of LEOsats to plan observations.
After setting the observing parameters in the configuration file "track.ini"
the code can be run via terminal with the command: "python track.py"

This package uses:
* Pyorbital package (https://github.com/pytroll/pyorbital).
