# LEOsat tracking
Low Earth orbit Satellite tracking code using supplemental TLE data from
Celestrak to calculate times and positions of LEOsats to plan observations.

# How to use the package:

## Low resolution track

* Set observing parameters in configuration file: track.ini
* run via terminal with: python track.py
### track.ini
## High resolution track with custom time window

* Set observing parameters in configuration file: custom_track.ini
* run via terminal with: python custom_track.py

This package relies on the following packages:
* pyorbital: https://github.com/pytroll/pyorbital.
* ephem: https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem
* Other packages listed in requirements.txt
